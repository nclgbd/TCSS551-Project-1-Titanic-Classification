    "# Titanic (Classification)\n",
    "Perhaps one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 people on board. Interestingly, by analysing the probability of survival based on few attributes like gender, age, and social status, we can make very accurate predictions on which passengers would survive. Some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class. Therefore, we can learn about the society priorities and privileges at the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **data population** is **[TODO]**\n",

    "# Assignment\n",
    "From the [Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.1 State Group Members [1 point]\n",
    "You can choose to finish the project individually or in group (up to 2 members). If you want to finish the whole project including stage-1, and stage-2 in group, please let the instructor know as soon as possible (before Oct 26, 2021). You are required to state clearly the members' full names. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.2 Problem Formulation/Introduction [5 points]\n",
    "At the beginning of your notebook, you are required to write an introduction of the problem, which will motivate the readers.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You need to carefully read the description of your chosen Kaggle competition and formulate the data problem you are going to solve similar to what we have discussed in class. Points will be deducted if the problem is not correctly describing the corresponding Kaggle problem or the problem formulation is not clear to understand even judge the previous point. [3 points]\n",
    "\n",
    "2. According to the problem, what's the data population? [2 points]\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.3 Data [38 points]\n",
    "Then, you can join the competition and download the data. You must include but not limited to the following items in your notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If you don't have a Kaggle account, you need to register one. Please include your account name in your notebook, which will be the one showing on the Leaderboard, when you submit your result in stage-2. [1 point]\n",
    "\n",
    "2. After you download the data, you need to load them to your notebook, show several lines of each separate file and describe what is that data for. [5 points]\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Data Wrangling: this is an open component and you need to transform the data into a data frame or data frames for analysis or visualization. However, you need to include the discussion for each data properties (i.e., structure, granularity, scope, temporality, and faithfulness), using the data (e.g., visualizations or statistical summaries) as evidences. If one property cannot be identified using the data, you also need to show and tell that this is not available. [25 points, 5 for each property]\n",
    "\n",
    "4. According to the data wrangling (maybe some visualizations), is the data obtained representative for the problem according to your data population? What kind of assumptions are needed that the analysis using the current data can solve the problem? [5 points]\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Comparing the data population and the given data, guess what kind of sampling method maybe used during the data collection and why do you guess so. [2 points]\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.4 Formats and Readability\n",
    "Your notebook should be well organized for the ease of reading as a good document that any follow-up data scientist can follow and understand. [0 points, -5 if hard to follow]\n",
    "\n",
    "Bonus points [+2] will be given to the best notebook or notebooks, which will be shared to all students in this class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Base project was worked on by me in late 2020, and I'm building off of this notebook for the course. Here is a link to the [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/deployment-of-machine-learning-models/) I worked on. "
